Download, uncompress it and move to the `pss-genome-fs` directory, where you will find: (1) a directory called `working_dir`, that contains the files required by the pipeline as described in the README; (2) a file called `run.sh`, that contains the commands to test the pipeline (you should set the `WORKING_DIR` path).
